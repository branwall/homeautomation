Thoughts on how to score weather:

Factors=
	Temperature
	Humidity
	Weathertype
	Visibility
	Wind(gust?)

I think scoring should be as follows:


Weathertype = 50% (allows for expansion; if we don't account for a weathertype script will still work)
Visibility = 20% (ie, fog will dominate)
Humidity = 15%
Temperature = 10%
Wind = 5%



Actually, let's try a different approach. Just look at type of weather. If a tie breaker is necessary (and I've noted when I think that's the case...) we can simply check the temperature. Doesn't need to be more complicated than this.  I don't think scoring is necessary.

Here are all the categories possible 

*L/H Drizzle
*L/H Rain
*L/H Snow
*L/H Snow Grains
*L/H Ice Crystals
*L/H Ice Pellets
*L/H Hail
*L/H Mist
*L/H Fog
*L/H Fog Patches
L/H Smoke
L/H Volcanic Ash
L/H Widespread Dust
L/H Sand
L/H Haze
L/H Spray
L/H Dust Whirls
L/H Sandstorm
*L/H Low Drifting Snow
L/H Low Drifting Widespread Dust
L/H Low Drifting Sand
*L/H Blowing Snow
L/H Blowing Widespread Dust
L/H Blowing Sand
*L/H Rain Mist
*L/H Rain Showers
*L/H Snow Showers
*L/H Snow Blowing Snow Mist
*L/H Ice Pellet Showers
*L/H Hail Showers
*L/H Small Hail Showers
*L/H Thunderstorm
*L/H Thunderstorms and Rain
*L/H Thunderstorms and Snow
*L/H Thunderstorms and Ice Pellets
*L/H Thunderstorms with Hail
*L/H Thunderstorms with Small Hail
*L/H Freezing Drizzle
*L/H Freezing Rain
*L/H Freezing Fog
*Patches of Fog
*Shallow Fog
*Overcast
*Clear
*Partly Cloudy
*Mostly Cloudy
*Scattered Clouds
*Small Hail
Squalls
Funnel Cloud

Now, for the categories we actually want:

Seems easy enough?
