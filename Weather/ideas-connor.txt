Split Weather-Alarm into two scripts:
	1) GetWeather - [grabs weather, RETURNS numerical value 1-10 for weather indexing
		this index determines from 1 (hot and clear) to 10 (cold and obfuscated) the weather]
	2) WeatherAlarm - Calls "GetWeather"; given time of day and weather index (1-10) this
		plays a specific music file from ambiance/music vault.

This will allow future expansion on weather indexing in case we ever have another
project that would require the weather index and we wouldnt need to change a goddamn thing
always program with expansion in mind.


Steps To Victory:
	1) Finalize Categories
	2) Make Maths to Categorize efficiently
	3) Download/host audio files
	4) Write final Alarm script 
	5) ????
	6) PROFIT
