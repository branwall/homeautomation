We will be using google drive to host our assets in an easily accessible manner.  The following code (untested) should
allow us to download an entire folder of assets, to be unzipped and then accessed and deleted (or cached forever...?)



NB: login to drive.google.com as myautomationserver
    pw = you can guess.
    

Upload files to the Weather Assets folder. Update them in the asset_list.txt accordingly. Then, when finished, delete the zip folder.
Go up one directory and download the whole folder as a .zip.  Then reupload the .zip INSIDE the Weather Assets folder.

Finally, get the link. Right click the .zip and select "share" to get the share link.

Paste the link here: https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/
And then add the output to our script. Output should look like this
